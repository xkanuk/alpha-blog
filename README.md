# README

Homework:

1. Create an alpha-blog application.

2. Setup tracking with Git and make a commit of your code with the message "Initial commit". Set up a GitHub repository for the app.

3. Create a home page view (as the root route) and an about page like the test app.

4. Make sure you are able to start the server and preview the application. Take snapshots of the two pages (home and about) and post them to the Q & A.

5. Make a commit of your code and push to your GitHub repository for the application.
